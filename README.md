This repository contains the entire code of the bachelor thesis

The code is sorted by occurrence in the thesis as follows:
1. Small visualizations for embedding + code outputs
2. Some Web scraping
3. Dataset building in SQuAD-like format
4. PoC of Retrieval-Augmented Generation system with a custom pipeline
5. Evaluation with 4 Retrievers, 3 LLMs on 2 small Datasets
7. Evaluation results for Retriever and Reader in .csv files

The annotation_tool from haystack can be used to locally annotate txt data with labels and output it in SQuAD format
